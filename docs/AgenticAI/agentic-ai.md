Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess agency, meaning they can make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate based on predefined rules or patterns, agentic AI can adapt to changing environments, learn from experiences, and interact with other agents or humans in a more dynamic manner.
