# Agentic AI
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess agency, meaning they can make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate based on predefined rules or patterns, agentic AI can adapt to changing environments, learn from experiences, and interact with other agents or humans in a more dynamic manner.
Agentic AI systems are often designed to simulate human-like behavior, allowing them to perform complex tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, and planning. They can operate in various domains, including robotics, virtual assistants, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.
Key characteristics of agentic AI include:
1. Autonomy: The ability to operate without human intervention.
2. Adaptability: The capacity to learn from experiences and adjust behavior accordingly.
3. Goal-oriented behavior: The capability to pursue specific objectives.
4. Interaction: The ability to communicate and collaborate with other agents or humans.
Agentic AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries by enabling more efficient and intelligent systems that can operate independently and make informed decisions. However, it also raises ethical and safety concerns, such as ensuring that these systems align with human values and do not cause harm.
